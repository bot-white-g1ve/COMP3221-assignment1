# HOW TO GENERATE RANDOM GRAPH
python3 graph_generator.py <dir_path>

The configs and the graph will be stored in <dir_path>

# HOW TO LAUNCH
You can launch a single node by:

python3 COMP3221_A1_Routing.py \<Node ID\> \<Port ID\> \<Config File Path\>

By default, the program will only print out the routing table after 60 seconds. If you want to change this time boundary, you can add another argument when launch the program:

python3 COMP3221_A1_Routing.py \<Node ID\> \<Port ID\> \<Config File Path\> \<time to print\>

# HOW TO TEST
If you want to test a whole network:

Firstly, change CURRENT_FOLDER_PATH variable in run.sh to the path to this root folder.

Run run.sh. If you want to test configs in a specific directory, change CONFIG_DIR variable in run.sh to the target directory.

Every node will also print out its current routing table every 20 seconds. You can also type in "routing table" command to check the current routing table.

By default, the program will only print out the routing table after 60 seconds. If you want to change this time boundary, change the variable time_to_print in run.sh.

# HOW TO USE THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
1. config:
   
        Print out the config file

1. shutdown
   
        Shutdown the node completely (terminate the program)
   
        args:

            -n [time]: Scheduled to shutdown the node in [time] seconds

2. routing table
   
        Print out the current routing table

3. change [neighbor] [new_cost]
   
        Change the link cost to [neighbor] to [new_cost]

4. disable

        The node will stop broadcasting packets and ignore received packets

5. enable
   
        The node will recover from "disabled" status

# Our features
1. Every node will send its own routing table to its neighbors every 10 seconds

2. When a node receives its neighbor's routing table, it will run the routing algorithm and update its own routing table.

3. 60s (this value can be set, refer to "HOW TO LAUNCH" and "HOW TO TEST") after launching (The network is stable), the node will print out its routing table every 20 seconds.
