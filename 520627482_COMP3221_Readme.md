# CODING ENVIRONMENT

# REQUIREMENTS.TXT
None

# HOW TO GENERATE
python3 graph_generator.py <dir_path>

# HOW TO LAUNCH
python3 COMP3221_A1_Routing.py <Node ID> <Port ID> <Config File Path>

# HOW TO TEST
When you are doing testing, remember that a node will only print its routing table when receive new information from its neighbors. So it won't automatically print out its routing table if you set its neighbor to disable (because we are simulating the situation that the neighbor is broken suddenly). But it will update its routing table. 

So use the command "routing table" when you want to check if a node's routing table is correct.

# HOW TO USE THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
1. config
Print out the config file

2. shutdown
Shutdown the node completely (terminate the program)
args:
    -n [time]: Scheduled to shutdown the nod in [time] seconds

3. routing table
Print out the current routing table

4. change [neighbor] [new_cost]
Change the link cost to [neighbor] to [new_cost]

5. disable
The node will stop broadcasting packets and ignore received packets

6. enable
The node will recover from "disabled" status

# Our features
1. Every node will send its own routing table to its neighbors every 10 seconds

2. When a node receives its neighbor's routing table, it will run the routing algorithm and update its own routing table.

3. 60s after launching (The network is stable), whenever routing algorithm completed, the node will print current routing information in the terminal.
