# CODING ENVIRONMENT
Python 3.11.4

# REQUIREMENTS.TXT
None

# HOW TO GENERATE RANDOM GRAPH
python3 graph_generator.py <dir_path>

# HOW TO LAUNCH
python3 COMP3221_A1_Routing.py <Node ID> <Port ID> <Config File Path>

# HOW TO TEST
Firstly, change CURRENT_FOLDER_PATH variable in run.sh to the path to this folder.

Run run.sh. If you want to test configs in a specific directory, change CONFIG_DIR variable in run.sh to the target directory.

When you are doing testing, remember that the automatically printed routing table may be outdated and incorrect (Because some change won't be print out, for example when you change a link's cost). So use the command "routing table" when you want to check if a node's routing table is correct (This command will for sure print out the current routing table).

Every node will also print out its current routing table every 60 seconds.

# HOW TO USE THE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
1. config
Print out the config file

2. shutdown
Shutdown the node completely (terminate the program)
args:
    -n [time]: Scheduled to shutdown the nod in [time] seconds

3. routing table
Print out the current routing table

4. change [neighbor] [new_cost]
Change the link cost to [neighbor] to [new_cost]

5. disable
The node will stop broadcasting packets and ignore received packets

6. enable
The node will recover from "disabled" status

# Our features
1. Every node will send its own routing table to its neighbors every 10 seconds

2. When a node receives its neighbor's routing table, it will run the routing algorithm and update its own routing table.

3. 60s after launching (The network is stable), whenever routing algorithm completed, the node will print current routing information in the terminal.
